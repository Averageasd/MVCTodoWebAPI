# About
To do project that demonstrates how MVC is implemented in .NET.
Repository and service layers are omitted for simplicity. Pagination is implemented so only 5 items are fetched from the database at a time when get api is hit. 

## Technologies
Backend: .NET Web API, in memory database.
Front end: Javascript, HTML, CSS. 

## Note
This focus of this project was on entity framework so the front end was very plain.
